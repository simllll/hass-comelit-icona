"""DataUpdateCoordinator for Comelit.

Owns the SINGLE shared, persistent, authenticated ICONA Bridge connection that
is the one owner of the ViP CTPP registration. Both the doorbell event listener
and the live-video session ATTACH to / REUSE this one connection's CTPP channel
— never a second one. Two CTPP registrations on one ViP identity make the
device drop video after ~3s, so this shared-connection design is load-bearing.

Config, door and actuator operations still use short-lived connections via the
legacy ``comelit_client`` (they don't hold CTPP, so they don't contend).
